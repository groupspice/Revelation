<noscript> Leader’s Notesconsider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.Session Two Su ering BelieversConnecting2. We encourage the group to rotate leaders and host homes each meeting. This practice will go a long way toward bonding the group. Review the Small Group Calendar and talk about who else is willing to open their home or facilitate a meeting. Rotating host homes and leadership along with implementing Team Roles as discussed in Session One will quickly move the group ownership from “your group” to “our group.”Growing4. He is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again (2:8). He tri- umphed over death, and the saints need to know this so that his triumph can help those who are being tempted to give up their faith under pressure.He is the one whose words are holy and true and who holds the key of David (the key to David’s royal palace, 3:7). Jesus is the only one in history who provides access to the presence of God and so reveals what is truth.6. The church at Smyrna is su ering a iction and poverty and is about to experience persecution from the devil for a period of ten days (perhaps a symbolic description of some local persecution); some will be imprisoned, but they must be faithful even to the point of death.Philadelphia has little strength (political in uence), but Jesus has placed before them an open door (an opportunity for bold witness) because they have kept Jesus’s word and have not denied his name.Christians in many parts of the world are su ering similarly. An Internet search could produce several news stories that might help bring this part of Revelation alive for your group members.7. Jesus promises the church in Smyrna that even if they su er physical death, he will reward them with eternal life and the victor’s crown.Jesus promises the church in Philadelphia that they will not only be welcome in God’s house but will be vital, weight-bearing parts of God’s house.8. God takes his relationships with his people seriously. He sees what is hap- pening in our lives and instructs us in di cult situations. He wants us to have a relationship with him and he tells us how we can do this.129 </noscript>
