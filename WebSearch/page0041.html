<noscript> Leader’s NotesJesus’s appearance encompasses all parts of God’s plan for humanity. His appearance also shows that he is the only one worthy to deliver God’s message to John, as he embodies power, strength, authority, knowledge, wisdom, and so on.8. John falls down at Jesus’s feet, as though dead. This is the appropriate response to seeing the glory of God. The  rst thing Christ says to John is the same thing he said to the women at the tomb: “Don’t be afraid!” (Matt. 28:5 NLT). There is no need for believers to fear. Jesus then identi es himself as the beginning and end of everything (see Isa. 44:6). He is also the living one—not a dead idol but resurrected, alive, and always with his people. He died—experienced physical death on the cross—but now is alive. Because Jesus rose from the dead, he can promise the same for his people. Death has no power over him (he holds the keys), so it should have no fear for believers. This was something signi cant to say to believers facing death for their faith.9. This passage promises that God will bless the reader of this book. In ad- dition to the reader, God blesses all who listen to it and obey what it says. “Listen” and “obey” are important terms and major themes of the book. The blessed ones are those who hear God’s word and then obey it so that it changes their lives (Eph. 4:13). These words will bless the hearers because through them they can get to know God better and be able to trust him more completely.No one knows when the prophecy in Revelation will come to pass, but Jesus assures us that it will be soon. Thus we should be prepared and remain ready for his return at any time.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.10. The intent of this discussion is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a commitment to a good Bible reading plan, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes their life.The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week127 </noscript>
