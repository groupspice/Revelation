<noscript> Leader’s Notespassages at home before coming to the group. Remember to be sensitive to those who are not comfortable reading aloud in a group.4. Jesus is giving to John the revelation that God gave him. His purpose is to show his servants what must soon take place. John claims that the authority for this book comes straight from Jesus.5. John was one of many persecuted believers who were partners in su ering as persecution escalated at the end of the  rst century AD. He was also a partner with other believers in God’s coming kingdom because, as believers, they were already citizens of the kingdom. And they were partners in patient endurance as they awaited the arrival of God’s coming kingdom. John had paid for his faithfulness in preaching the word of God and speaking about Jesus by being exiled to the island of Patmos. The Romans used Patmos as a place to banish political prisoners.6. This question is designed to encourage people to discuss what John was going through as he received this revelation from God. Many interpreters believe he was transported (either physically or spiritually) out of the natural world to a Holy Spirit-empowered experience beyond the normal—he was not just dreaming.7. Refer to the verses noted in the chart as you discuss each one. The word used here for robe is most frequently used to depict the garment worn by the high priest, one who goes into God’s presence to obtain forgiveness of sin for those who have believed in him. The golden sash completes this priestly picture. His hair like white wool, like snow, indicates his wisdom and divine nature (see Dan. 7:9). His eyes like  re symbolize deep insight over the churches and the entire course of history (see 2:18; 19:12) and judgment over evil (see Dan. 10:6). The feet like bronze is a picture of a person with great power—exalted. Bronze usually symbolized the might of Rome. The voice like the sound of rushing waters (see 19:6) evokes the image of a voice so powerful and awesome that, when it speaks with author- ity, nothing else can be heard. The seven stars are explained in Revelation 1:20: “The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches” (NIV) to whom this letter is addressed. That Christ is holding the stars implies his protection of these churches as he walks among them. The double-edged sword was sharp on both edges. These swords gave a great advantage in hand-to-hand combat. This sword coming from Jesus’s mouth symbolizes the power and force of his message. Jesus’s words of judgment are as sharp as swords; he is completely invincible. The face brilliant like the sun probably describes Christ’s entire being—his glory. The same picture is described in the Trans guration—an event John witnessed (Matt. 17:2).126 </noscript>
