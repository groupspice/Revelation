        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overemphasize one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship. Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, ministry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a memory verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection withGod and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn7]]></text>

You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker ques- tion, and/or you can check in with one or two group members—your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encouragement in your spiritual journey.DVD TEACHING SEGMENT. A Deepening Life Together: Reve- lation Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is avail- able. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Ray Bentley. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section). At the end of each session in this study guide you will  nd space for your notes on the teach- ing segment.GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.8]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstSHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders con- nect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (Optional)If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more biblical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide9]]></text>

These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group.You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the Deepening Life Together Bible study on the book of Revelation. You are about to embark on journey into understanding God’s wondrous plan of redemption for the world. We will take you step-by-step through Jesus’s revelation to the apostle John—the vi- sion of God’s throne room, the Lord’s judgment of humanity, and the hope we can all share because of God’s abundant mercy. What you will discover as you study through this  nal book of the Bible will inspire, encourage, and edify your faith, in addition to strengthening your life’s journey with the Lord.For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want to encourage you that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you respond to the principles you learn, God will empower your growth. Approach this study prayerfully and God will move you to a deeper level of com- mitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.This journey of discovery will make known God’s purposes for our lives. We will connect with our loving and faithful God and with other believers in small group community. We will become his hands and feet here on earth as he reveals our uniqueness and his willing- ness to use us. We will experience the closeness that he desires with us as we prayerfully respond to the principles we learn in this study and learn to place him  rst in our lives.11]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONESETTINGAUDIENCE AND THE REVEALERMemory Verse: “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty” (Rev. 1:8).Anne loved her Nana’s visits. Nana lived in a di erent state, but she came to visit at least once a year. From the moment she learned of Nana’s impending arrival, Anne would impatiently count down the days with eagerness and anticipation. On the appointed day, she and her parents would go to the airport together to greet Nana. The minutes would drag on like months as she pressed her nose against the cold pane of the air terminal glass, searching for signs of the plane.When Anne saw the lights blinking in the distance and heard the rumble of the engine, excitement tingled through her. As the pas- sengers disembarked, Anne would watch them pass by, one by one, looking for her fair-haired Nana. Eventually she would emerge, and Anne would run toward her, thrilled to see her again and receive one of her wonderful hugs.Christians are also anticipating a special and important arrival. While the apostle John was exiled on the island of Patmos, Jesus revealed to him the circumstances surrounding his return to earth.13]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[RevelationAlthough we don’t know the exact time when our Savior will come again, we do know that he will return and “every eye will see him.” Jesus told John of his redemptive plan for his people and for creation. It is a plan we can all look forward to.ConnectingPrayer is a powerful way to connect as a group. Open your group with prayer and invite the Holy Spirit to lead you as you begin your study in the book of Revelation.Deeper relationships happen when we take the time to keep in touch with one another between sessions. As you begin, pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. When the roster gets to you write down your contact information, including the best time and method for contacting you. Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married/how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your values together. In the Appen- dix is a Small Group Agreement with the values most useful in developing and sustaining healthy, balanced small groups. Choose two or three values that you haven’t previously focused on, or have room to grow in, to emphasize during this study. Choose values that will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.14]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SettingIf your group is new, you may want to focus on welcoming newcomers or on sharing group ownership. Any group will quickly move from being the leader’s group to our group if everyone understands the goals of the group and shares a small role. See the Team Roles in the Appendix for help on how to do this well.3. Share your expectations for the study. How do you hope God will challenge you?GrowingIn the  rst chapter of Revelation, John is in exile on the island of Patmos when he receives a vision from Jesus (see the Study Notes for more information on Patmos). John is directed to address the churches in Asia (see the Study Notes for more information on the churches) who are in various states of obedience, compromise, and persecution. Even though John’s audience is those churches in par- ticular, he gives this message to all readers: “Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near” (Rev. 1:3 NIV).Take turns reading through Revelation 1 aloud.4. Who is giving the revelation (1:1)? Why does this matter?What is the purpose of the revelation (1:1–2)?5. John is in exile on the island of Patmos when he receives this revelation. What does verse 1:9 say about John and why he is on the island?What is signi cant to you about the way John chooses to de- scribe himself and the Christian life as he experiences it?6. When John hears the Lord’s voice he is “in the Spirit” (v. 10)? What do you think it means to be “in the Spirit”?15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Setting“The time is near” (v. 3). What do you think this means? See Matthew 24:36–39 and 2 Peter 3:3–10 for help.John is allowed to witness Jesus in his glori ed state. Jesus appears to him and instructs him to record Jesus’s message for posterity. Throughout chapter 1, John is reassured by Jesus’s assertions of his sovereignty and power. As our study in Revelation continues, we will discover what awaits humanity and how believers can  nd hope through God’s plan of redemption.DevelopingJesus used John to communicate God’s plan of redemption to the world. John took his role as God’s servant seriously. We too are God’s servants, and we are called to use our gifts and talents to serve his kingdom.10. Developing our ability to serve God according to the leading of the Holy Spirit requires that we make time to let God speak to us daily. Which of the following next steps toward this goal are you willing to take for the next few weeks?t Prayer. Commit to daily time in personal, focused prayer and connection with God. Find a place where you can be alone and undistracted. You may  nd it helpful to write your prayers in a journal.t Re ection. At the end of each session you’ll  nd Re ec- tions—Scriptures that speci cally relate to the topic of our study each week. These are provided to give you an oppor- tunity for reading a short Bible passage  ve days a week during the course of this study. Write down your insights on what you read each day in the space provided. On the sixth day, summarize what God has shown you throughout the week.t Meditation. Meditation is focused attention on the Word of God—a great way to internalize God’s Word more deeply. Copy a portion of Scripture on a card and tape it some-17]]></text>

Think about it when you sit at red lights, while you get ready for your day, or while you’re eating a meal. Re ect on what God is saying to you through these words. Consider using the memory verse and Re ections verses provided each week for meditation.SharingJesus commissioned all of his disciples to be his witnesses in Acts 1:8: “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (NIV). We become witnesses through our everyday lives. But he does not expect us to do it alone; the Holy Spirit will empower us to con dently serve and share him with others as we trust in him.11. In the weeks to come, you’ll be asked to identify and share with people in your circle of in uence who need to know Jesus or need to connect with him through a small group community. With this in mind, as you go about your day-to-day activities this week, pay special attention to the people God has placed in your life. There may be co-workers, family or friends, or other parents at school or sporting events that you see or talk to on a regular basis. When we meet next week, we’ll talk about how we can begin sharing Jesus with those who don’t yet know him as well as how to help connect believers to Christian community.SurrenderingJohn was “in the Spirit” when he received Jesus’s revelation. Just like John, we must surrender ourselves to the Lord in order to do his will. This can be accomplished through dedicated prayer and worship.18]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Setting12. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. Your time with God is personal and re ects who you are in relationship with God. However you choose to spend your time with him, try to allow time for praise, prayer, and read- ing of Scripture. Re ections are provided at the end of each session for you to use as part of your daily time with him. These will o er reinforcement of the principles we are learn- ing, and develop or strengthen your habit of time alone with God throughout the week.13. Before you close your group in prayer, allow everyone to answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.Study NotesBlessed: Blessed here means spiritually favored, fortunate, well o .Patmos: A small (four by eight miles), rocky island in the Aegean Sea, about 50 miles southwest of Ephesus, o  the coast of modern day Turkey.Prophecy: Revelation is a book of prophecy that is both prediction (foretelling future events) and proclamation (preaching about who God is and what he will do). Behind the predictions are important principles about God’s character and promises.Seven: Nearly two-thirds of the uses of seven in the New Testament are symbolic uses found in Revelation. The symbolism conveys the message that both judgment and salvation are complete, or at least will be in the  nal consummation. It is used to describe lampstands (Rev. 1:12), stars (1:16), angels (1:20), spirits of God (3:1), seals (5:1), trumpets (8:2), heads of a dragon (12:3), plagues (15:1), etc.19]]></text>

The churches were possibly the postal centers of the seven geographic regions in the area.ReflectionsReading, re ecting, and meditating on the Word of God is essential to getting to know him deeply. As you read the verses each day, give prayerful consideration to what you learn about God, his Spirit, and his place in your life. Then record your thoughts, insights, or prayer in the Re ect section below the verses you read. On the sixth day, record a summary of what you learned over the entire week through this study.Day 1.

A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a fewpeopleorforexistinggroupsthatloseafewpeoplealongtheway. We encourage you to pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another good strategy is to ask church leaders to make an announcement that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too83]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked Questionssmall, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s totally up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months together, but every other week can work as well. We strongly recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if at all possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch relationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direction, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have something to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will ma- ture and members will share the facilitation of meetings. We have discovered that healthy groups share hosting and leading of the group. This model ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.84]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. You may try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to meet in the living room or dining room, and share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can be with the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their children all evening when their children are too young to be left at home. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the responsi- bility of providing a lesson or care for the children either in the same home or in another home nearby. This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. No mat- ter what decision the group makes, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.85]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One Setting: Audience and the RevealerConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to answer this introductory question at this  rst session.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.We recommend talking about shared ownership of the group. It’s impor- tant that each member have a role. See the Appendix to learn more about Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.GrowingThis session covers Revelation 1. Reading the entire selection aloud may be time-consuming so we recommend that you ask the group to read these125LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notespassages at home before coming to the group. Remember to be sensitive to those who are not comfortable reading aloud in a group.4. Jesus is giving to John the revelation that God gave him. His purpose is to show his servants what must soon take place. John claims that the authority for this book comes straight from Jesus.5. John was one of many persecuted believers who were partners in su ering as persecution escalated at the end of the  rst century AD. He was also a partner with other believers in God’s coming kingdom because, as believers, they were already citizens of the kingdom. And they were partners in patient endurance as they awaited the arrival of God’s coming kingdom. John had paid for his faithfulness in preaching the word of God and speaking about Jesus by being exiled to the island of Patmos. The Romans used Patmos as a place to banish political prisoners.6. This question is designed to encourage people to discuss what John was going through as he received this revelation from God. Many interpreters believe he was transported (either physically or spiritually) out of the natural world to a Holy Spirit-empowered experience beyond the normal—he was not just dreaming.7. Refer to the verses noted in the chart as you discuss each one. The word used here for robe is most frequently used to depict the garment worn by the high priest, one who goes into God’s presence to obtain forgiveness of sin for those who have believed in him. The golden sash completes this priestly picture. His hair like white wool, like snow, indicates his wisdom and divine nature (see Dan. 7:9). His eyes like  re symbolize deep insight over the churches and the entire course of history (see 2:18; 19:12) and judgment over evil (see Dan. 10:6). The feet like bronze is a picture of a person with great power—exalted. Bronze usually symbolized the might of Rome. The voice like the sound of rushing waters (see 19:6) evokes the image of a voice so powerful and awesome that, when it speaks with author- ity, nothing else can be heard. The seven stars are explained in Revelation 1:20: “The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches” (NIV) to whom this letter is addressed. That Christ is holding the stars implies his protection of these churches as he walks among them. The double-edged sword was sharp on both edges. These swords gave a great advantage in hand-to-hand combat. This sword coming from Jesus’s mouth symbolizes the power and force of his message. Jesus’s words of judgment are as sharp as swords; he is completely invincible. The face brilliant like the sun probably describes Christ’s entire being—his glory. The same picture is described in the Trans guration—an event John witnessed (Matt. 17:2).126]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesJesus’s appearance encompasses all parts of God’s plan for humanity. His appearance also shows that he is the only one worthy to deliver God’s message to John, as he embodies power, strength, authority, knowledge, wisdom, and so on.8. John falls down at Jesus’s feet, as though dead. This is the appropriate response to seeing the glory of God. The  rst thing Christ says to John is the same thing he said to the women at the tomb: “Don’t be afraid!” (Matt. 28:5 NLT). There is no need for believers to fear. Jesus then identi es himself as the beginning and end of everything (see Isa. 44:6). He is also the living one—not a dead idol but resurrected, alive, and always with his people. He died—experienced physical death on the cross—but now is alive. Because Jesus rose from the dead, he can promise the same for his people. Death has no power over him (he holds the keys), so it should have no fear for believers. This was something signi cant to say to believers facing death for their faith.9. This passage promises that God will bless the reader of this book. In ad- dition to the reader, God blesses all who listen to it and obey what it says. “Listen” and “obey” are important terms and major themes of the book. The blessed ones are those who hear God’s word and then obey it so that it changes their lives (Eph. 4:13). These words will bless the hearers because through them they can get to know God better and be able to trust him more completely.No one knows when the prophecy in Revelation will come to pass, but Jesus assures us that it will be soon. Thus we should be prepared and remain ready for his return at any time.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.10. The intent of this discussion is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a commitment to a good Bible reading plan, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes their life.The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week127]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="42">
        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesafter the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to see the importance of making this time to connect with God a priority in their life. Encourage them to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.Suggested exercise: To help the group get started with meditating on the Word of God, consider providing everyone with a 3×5 index card. Have everyone write this week’s memory verse on the card and begin memoriz- ing Scripture together.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.11. This activity should get the group to observe their interactions during the coming week with the intention of using these observations next week in evaluating the people that God has placed in their lives that he might want them to share with or invite to small group.SurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will provide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.12. Encourage group members to use the Re ections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while re- inforcing the lesson of this session through study of related Scripture.13. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in con dence if you are to have safety and bonding within the group members.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in each ses- sion. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study,128]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesconsider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.Session Two Su ering BelieversConnecting2. We encourage the group to rotate leaders and host homes each meeting. This practice will go a long way toward bonding the group. Review the Small Group Calendar and talk about who else is willing to open their home or facilitate a meeting. Rotating host homes and leadership along with implementing Team Roles as discussed in Session One will quickly move the group ownership from “your group” to “our group.”Growing4. He is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again (2:8). He tri- umphed over death, and the saints need to know this so that his triumph can help those who are being tempted to give up their faith under pressure.He is the one whose words are holy and true and who holds the key of David (the key to David’s royal palace, 3:7). Jesus is the only one in history who provides access to the presence of God and so reveals what is truth.6. The church at Smyrna is su ering a iction and poverty and is about to experience persecution from the devil for a period of ten days (perhaps a symbolic description of some local persecution); some will be imprisoned, but they must be faithful even to the point of death.Philadelphia has little strength (political in uence), but Jesus has placed before them an open door (an opportunity for bold witness) because they have kept Jesus’s word and have not denied his name.Christians in many parts of the world are su ering similarly. An Internet search could produce several news stories that might help bring this part of Revelation alive for your group members.7. Jesus promises the church in Smyrna that even if they su er physical death, he will reward them with eternal life and the victor’s crown.Jesus promises the church in Philadelphia that they will not only be welcome in God’s house but will be vital, weight-bearing parts of God’s house.8. God takes his relationships with his people seriously. He sees what is hap- pening in our lives and instructs us in di cult situations. He wants us to have a relationship with him and he tells us how we can do this.129]]></text>
